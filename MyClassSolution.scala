```scala
class MyClass(val value: Int) {
  def this() = this(0) // Auxiliary constructor
  def this(value1: Int, value2: Int) = this(value1 + value2)
}
```
This solution shows a robust auxiliary constructor that handles other cases. The additional constructor will now properly call the primary or another constructor, making sure the class remains functional regardless of the number of constructors with non-default parameters.
