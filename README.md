This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to auxiliary constructors in Scala.  The initial `MyClass` has a primary constructor and an auxiliary constructor that works correctly. However, if a second constructor with non-default parameters is added, the auxiliary constructor will fail to compile because it doesn't properly call another constructor.  The solution demonstrates a way to fix this issue.
